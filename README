  जलस्तर (Water Level)
------------------------------------------------------------


BRIEF

As name suggests, this application is used to measure the
level of water in tanks at home.

The level information is provided as JSON data to be used
in a graphical front-end.


DETAILS

I recently started playing with the ESP8266 12-E. This is
my first project using the chip.

Here, the goal is to measure water level in the overhead
and underground tanks used in most homes.

The overall project, of course, includes the hardware and
an Android application.
